  heterogeneous multi-logic setting. For practically realistic cases,

  approximates the weaker notion but obtains a colimit whenever
  possible. This algorithm is being implemented as part of the
  Heterogeneous Tool Set Hets.},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous specification becomes more and more important because
	complex systems are often specified using multiple viewpoints, involving
	multiple formalisms. Moreover, a formal software development process
	may lead to a change of formalism during the development. However,
	current research in integrated formal methods only deals with ad-hoc
	integrations of different formalisms.
	
	The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is a parsing, static analysis and
	proof management tool combining various such tools for individual
	specification languages, thus providing a tool for heterogeneous
	multi-logic specification. Hets is based on a graph of logics and
	languages (formalized as so-called institutions), their tools, and
	their translations. This provides a clean semantics of heterogeneous
	specification, as well as a corresponding proof calculus. For proof
	management, the calculus of development graphs (known from other
	large-scale proof management systems) has been adapted to heterogeneous
	specification. Development graphs provide an overview of the (heterogeneous)
	specification module hierarchy and the current proof state, and thus
	may be used for monitoring the overall correctness of a heterogeneous
	development.},
