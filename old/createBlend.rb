# ------ calls hets to create blend

def create_blend(base, inputSpace1, inputSpace2, morphism1, morphism2, backgroundKnowledge, blendRequirement)

  # TASKS:
  # create the DOL file

   # with your fileread method, which should be renamed

  # use HETS interactively to generate a .th file with the colimit
 
  # I will do this part

   # Comments for myself: we must go from the colimit in HETS to RDF/XML
   # maybe we need a HETS flag for this

  # the result should be pushed to Ontohub so we know where the ontology lives
 
  # write a method that pretty-prints an ontology to a file and 
  # then pushes the file to Ontohub
  # use the system method to call git add & git commit & git push
  
  # parse the colimit into an instance of the Ontology class, that is returned as result
    # using the parser that Pradeep is writing
  
end
